Since the popularization of the internet, scalability in global applications has become an increasingly significant challenge, especially with the rise of technologies that enable real-time interactions between users. This paper explores the challenges and solutions related to scalability in such applications, using the Codeboard UERJ platform as a case study. Developed for remote learning, Codeboard provides a collaborative real-time programming environment, allowing simultaneous interactions between teachers and students. The study addresses fundamental concepts of web development, cloud computing, and real-time communication, as well as the implementation of advanced practices in horizontal and vertical scalability, load balancing, and fault tolerance. The cloud infrastructure was designed to handle high demands, leveraging technologies such as WebSockets, MongoDB, Redis, and Auto Scaling. The tests conducted demonstrated the effectiveness of the implemented strategies, ensuring consistent performance and reliability even under adverse conditions. This work contributes to the advancement of distributed systems engineering and serves as a practical reference for developers and software architects interested in scalable and highly available solutions.
